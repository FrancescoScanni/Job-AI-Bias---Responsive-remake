# JobRadar - AI bias after image generation

"JobRADAR" is the name of a research made by high school students that aims to detect and document the bias of several AI during image generation. These are often related to gender, ethnicity, and social roles. This work consists of the homepage of this project (built in standard TAILWIND and SWIPER.js front end logic), hopefully updateable soon!
